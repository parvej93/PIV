Image Registration and Processing Script for Pfinder Module

This script performs image registration and processing as part of the Pfinder module.
It aligns a moving image to a reference image using ORB feature matching, crops the aligned image, 
and prepares the output for downstream analysis such as bead displacement and pressure calculations.

FUNCTIONALITY:
1. Load and preprocess images:
   - Enhances image contrast using CLAHE.
   - Masks the center of the image to focus on features for alignment.
2. Image registration:
   - Uses ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) to detect keypoints.
   - Matches keypoints and calculates an affine transformation matrix.
   - Aligns the moving image to the reference image.
3. Image cropping:
   - Crops both reference and aligned images to a specified region of interest (ROI).
4. Save and visualize results:
   - Saves the processed images to the output directory.
   - Displays the cropped reference and aligned images for verification.

INPUTS:
    
1. `image_paths`: List of two image file paths:
   - Path to the reference image (first in the list).
   - Path to the moving image (second in the list).
2. `output_dir`: Path to the directory where the processed images will be saved.
3. `crop_size`: User-defined ratio for cropping (value between `0` and `0.99`):
   - For example, `0.8` retains 80% of the original image width and height, cropping 10% from each side.

OUTPUTS:
- Saves the aligned and cropped image to the specified output directory.
- Displays the processed images (reference and aligned).

DEPENDENCIES:
- OpenCV (cv2): For image processing and alignment.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing results.
- ImageIO: For loading and saving images.
- OS: For handling file paths and directories.

WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:
- Prepares processed images for bead displacement analysis.
- Outputs can be used in subsequent Pfinder steps such as bead selection and pressure calculation.
